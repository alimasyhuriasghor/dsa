# Hi! Welcome To My `google-official-guide` Branch
This [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) is meant to share my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithm) tutorial from [Google Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/). This branch is also used to make the concise version of its original site.
